        <p>Today was one of those days that reminded me why I love what I do and the people I get to share life with. We spent the day at Soundwaves as a family, all while planning some last-minute Bitcoin Takeover Week activities and getting everything dialed in. It was a mix of work and play‚Äîexactly how I like it.</p>

        <p>One of my personal wins today was getting in 10 minutes of coding with Cursor. It might not sound like much, but I actually made a meaningful update to BitcoinPark.com‚Äîupdated some links and ensured they open in a new tab. Small change, but one I'm proud of. More importantly, it reinforced a bigger lesson for me:</p>

        <div class="emoji-bullet">üîπ Learn the core principle.</div>
        <div class="emoji-bullet">üîπ Do it yourself.</div>
        <div class="emoji-bullet">üîπ Teach it to someone else.</div>

        <p>In this case, it was coding. Pulling down the repository, creating a new branch, making edits, and submitting a pull request to ultimately be merged‚Äîit's a simple workflow, but understanding it well enough to apply it and eventually teach it is the real win.</p>

        <p>And the best part of the day? The kids had a blast. Those moments remind me why I do all of this in the first place.</p>
